# Peak Performance: vertical relief influences fish density and community assemblage structure across a heterogenous restoration reefscape.

## Abstract
To restore sections of temperate rocky-reef degraded by sedimentation, scour, and burial a large quarry rock reef, Palos Verdes Reef (PVR), was built with high-relief elements intended to increase fish biomass productivity and support a more diverse reef community. The large size and replicated design features within the PVR restoration area provided a unique opportunity to study effects of reef design on fish habitat selection patterns during early phases of reef succession. To determine how vertical relief and other design elements influence reef fish density, assemblage structure, and species or size-class specific habitat use patterns on PVR we conducted diver-operated stereo-video camera surveys on all 18 PVR modules 9-13 months post-construction during June and July of 2021. Video analyses suggest that sections of PVR with higher vertical relief typically supported greater fish densities, but species and size-class specific exceptions suggest that habitat heterogeneity is an ideal design element to support diverse reef fish assemblages and ontogenetic life history stages. We also found evidence of a spatial gradient in the restoration area suggesting that fish densities, especially for planktivorous species, tended to be higher on sections of PVR further offshore. Planktivorous fishes are known to mediate benthic-pelagic coupling on temperate rocky-reefs through consumer mediated nutrient transport which will likely influence rates of primary and secondary productivity across PVR. Future restoration efforts should include habitat heterogeneity to support more diverse taxa but should also consider how reef design may influence rates of productivity to meet restoration objections.

## Manuscript Highlights

- Module orientation, side, and habitat types influence submodule level focal fish species assemblage structure
- Spatial variability in production could be associated with PVR reef relief leading to sweet spots of high fish densities
- Species-specific habitat use patterns were present across 24 unique combinations of design features and reef characteristics including 6 habitat types, 2 orientations, and 4 sides possible on PVR modules.
